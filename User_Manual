# StaffPlanalytics User Manual

This document provides detailed technical guidance on using the `StaffPlanalytics` simulation package for service center workforce planning. It is intended for developers, analysts, or operational planners seeking to understand and extend the functionality.

---

## 📦 Overview

`StaffPlanalytics` is a modular Python package that uses discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based modeling (ABM) to replicate service center operations and analyze technician staffing scenarios. It helps identify bottlenecks, optimize technician levels, and improve service center performance.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

1. **Realistic Operational Modeling**
2. **Queue Management (First Come, First Serve)**
3. **Technician Utilization Tracking**
4. **Scenario Testing (what-if analysis)**
5. **Bottleneck Identification**
6. **Customer Satisfaction Metrics**

## ⚙️ Simulation Architecture

The package consists of three modules:

- `declare.py`: Defines input parameters and simulation constants.
- `utils.py`: Houses core classes (Vehicle, Technician, ServiceCenter) and utility functions.
- `main.py`: Runs the simulation by orchestrating the flow.

### Class Summary

#### Vehicle
- Tracks service status, duration, waiting time.

#### Technician
- Tracks working hours, availability, number of services completed.

#### ServiceCenter
- Tracks queue, serviced vehicles, technician assignment, and all performance metrics per month.

## ▶️ Running a Simulation

Example flow from `main.py`:

```python
from utils import *
import declare as dcl

# Step 1: Load and process demand data
df, volume_dict = calculate_service_centers_monthly_delivered_volume(dcl.service_center_delivered_df)

# Step 2: Initialize service center objects
service_centers = create_service_centers(...)

# Step 3: Run simulations for each staffing level
for center in service_centers:
    for n_techs in range(dcl.min_techs, dcl.max_techs + 1):
        perf_report, _ = simulate_service_centers_performance(...)
        # Collect & export metrics
```

---

## 📊 Output

Main output: `all_service_centers_average_monthly_performance_metrics.csv`

Each row contains:
- Service center ID
- Month
- Number of technicians
- KPIs: queue length, waiting time, utilization, number of services completed, etc.

---

## 🔍 Performance Metrics

### Monthly Metrics
- Number of services requested (pre & post)
- Fulfilled vs. backlog services
- Queue waiting time
- Technician worked hours

### Cumulative Metrics
- Running totals across all months per scenario
